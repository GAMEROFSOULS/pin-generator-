# pin-generator-



This project is a simple Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for generating random Personal Identification Numbers (PINs). The project is built using the `tkinter` library for the GUI and the `random` and `string` libraries for PIN generation.

## Features

- **Generate Random PINs**: The application generates a random PIN based on the length specified by the user.
- **Customizable PIN Length**: Users can input the desired length of the PIN.
- **Simple and Intuitive GUI**: The application has a clean and easy-to-use interface.
